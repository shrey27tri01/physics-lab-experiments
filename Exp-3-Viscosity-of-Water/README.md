## Experiment:

The flow of water through an orifice at the bottom of a cylindrical bottle has been explored in this experiment.  
● The height of water level inside the bottle has been measured with a meter scale (eg. ​14cm, 13cm​ etc.)  
● The range of efflux of water from the orifice at the bottom of the bottle has been measured using a meter scale (eg. ​12.6cm, 11.8cm​ etc.)  
● Time has been measured in seconds manually using a stopwatch, at
different height levels (eg. ​height = 14cm​ at ​time elapsed = 20sec​, ​height = 13cm​ at ​time elapsed = 43sec​, and so on)
