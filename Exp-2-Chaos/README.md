## Observations:

The plots of t<sub>n+1</sub>​ vs​ t<sub>n</sub> have been plotted based on the datasets obtained from the accoustic stopwatch from the Phyphox mobile app.   
- Inaccuracies in the experimental data are inevitable, because of the disturbances in the surroundings. Still, the observations have been tried to be made as close as possible to the ideal (theoretical) data.    
- Due to non-ideal conditions and environmental disturbances, period doubling has only been observed once in the setup.    
- **Setup**: ​ We obtain different plots for different values of H, where H is the height of water level in the reservoir, to which a tap is attached, and the time elapsed is measured between subsequent drops of water dripping from the tap on the reservoir.    
- The control parameter (​r) in the setup is H, which, as has been described above, is the height of water level in the reservoir.   
- Hence, the graphs are plotted keeping with​ H being the control parameter.    
- The behaviour exhibited by the leaking tap can be compared with that of a logistic map.
